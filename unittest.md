####PyUnit

PyUnit is the Python equivalent of JUnit is Java which was written by Kent Beck and Eric Gamma. It is also called as unnittest. It is widely used for testing. The design on PyUnit is based on xUnit framework. Hence, we also find frameworks similar to it in C, Perl, Smalltalk, etc. It supports test fixtures.

In the figure above, we see the unittest module. There are five key classes in unittest :

<p><b>TestCase :</b></p>
This class is used to create new test cases. Its instances are single test cases.


<p><b>TestSuite :</b></p>
This class allows individual tests and test suites to be aggregrated. It acts like a collection container.


<p><b>TestLoader :</b></p>
This class is used to automate the process of creating a testsuite and populating it with individual tests.


<p><b>TextTestRunner:</b></p>
This reports the test results on the standard error streams. It provides a standard platform for tests to run.

<p><b>TestResults:</b></p>
This class is used as a result object. All results could be accessed here.
