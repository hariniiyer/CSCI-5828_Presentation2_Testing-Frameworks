<b>MODULAR TESTING FRAMEWORK</b>

- Modular testing framework is one of the most basic type of automation framework. 

- In this framework, each module (functionality) is separated out and handled independently.

- It requires the creation of small, independent scripts that represent modules, sections, and functions of the application-under-test.

- These scripts are then used in a hierarchical fashion to construct large tests.

- Since this framework includes the principle of abstraction, maintaining the test scripts are easy and also scalability can be achieved.

There are two types of modular driven framework

- Test Script Modularity Framework: 
   - creates small independent scripts representing modules.
