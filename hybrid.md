<b>HYBRID TESTING FRAMEWORK</b>

- Since each and every framework has its advantages and disadvantages, to make maximum use of all the advantages of different frameworks, hybrid testing framework was introduced.

- As the name suggests this hybrid framework is a combination of one or more frameworks (keyword driven, data driven and modular).

- It allows the data driven scripts to make use of the powerful libraries that is present in the keyword driven architecture framework thus making the data driven scripts less prone to failures.

- It also implements extensive error and unexpected window handling.

- It is useful for automating tests for medium and large applications.
