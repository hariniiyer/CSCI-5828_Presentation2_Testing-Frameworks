##### PYTEST

Quoting Brian Okken "use-this-unless-you-have-a-reason-not-to test framework", pytest is a testing framework for Python that is mature and full featured. It was written by Holger Kerkel. 

It is one of the most powerful python testing tools which does not need an API. 

The key features of pytest are :

+ It provides easy no-boilerplate testing
+ It can do simple unit testing as well as complex functional testing
+ It can be integrated with other testing tools and methodologies 
+ It can be customized to work on difference systems
+ It has extensive plugin

<p><b>No Boilerplate testing :</b></p>
In testing, there is a concept known as Boilerplate. It is nothing but a repetitive block of code which is reused. We can consider it to be a 'fill-in-the-blanks template'. Such type of code is not to be found is pytest. Hence, it is called as a no boilerplate framework. 

<p><b>Higly scalable from unit tests to complex functional tests:</b></p>
We have test fixtures in pytest which are nothing but a set of objects with a fixed state. There are used as a standard while running tests. These fixtures are used for complex programs. But pytest also supports a unittest type of test on the code. It simple but scalable to multiple instances. It also has strong backward compatibility which makes it very efficient.
