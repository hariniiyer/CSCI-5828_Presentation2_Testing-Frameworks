#### PYTEST

Quoting Brian Okken <b>"use-this-unless-you-have-a-reason-not-to test framework"</b>, pytest is a testing framework for Python that is mature and full featured. It was written by Holger Kerkel. 

It is one of the most powerful python testing tools which does not need an API. 

The key features of pytest are :

+ It provides easy no-boilerplate testing
+ It can do simple unit testing as well as complex functional testing
+ It can be integrated with other testing tools and methodologies 
+ It can be customized to work on difference systems
+ It has extensive plugin

<p><b>No Boilerplate testing :</b></p>
In testing, there is a concept known as Boilerplate. It is nothing but a repetitive block of code which is reused. We can consider it to be a 'fill-in-the-blanks template'. Such type of code is not to be found is pytest. Hence, it is called as a no boilerplate framework. 

<p><b>Higly scalable from unit tests to complex functional tests:</b></p>
We have test fixtures in pytest which are nothing but a set of objects with a fixed state. There are used as a standard while running tests. These fixtures are used for complex programs. But pytest also supports a unittest type of test on the code. It simple but scalable to multiple instances. It also has strong backward compatibility which makes it very efficient. It is very flexible.


<p><b>Integration with other tools and methods:</b></p>
One very convienient feature about pytest is that it can easily integrate techniques such as node, unnittest and docstyle within itself. It can also work with. Dependencies can be installed using pip. It can also run non-python test cases made for Django and trial. 


<p><b>Large plugin collection and customizable to work on different systems</b></p>
It has many third party plugins and it also easy to write our own plugin. It can be customized on basis of a released plugin. COmmand line options are also easy to add.
