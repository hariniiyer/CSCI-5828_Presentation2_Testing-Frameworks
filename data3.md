<b>ADVANTAGES</b>

-	They have a good test coverage.
-	By using this framework we can execute multiple test cases from a single test script.
-	The test logic can be reused.

<b>DISADVANTAGES</b>

-	The test data sets are hard-coded in the test script and the test cases are similar. In order to test a different type of test case, we will have to create new driver scripts which makes the testing more complex and hard.

Some of the sources to store the data (input and output) for this framework are :

-	Excel files  

-	CSV files – stores details of inputs and outputs in a tabular structure in 
plain text.

-	ODBC sources – includes database management systems.

-	Data Access Object – provides an abstract interface to a database.
