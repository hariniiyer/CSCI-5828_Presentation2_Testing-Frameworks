<b>DATA DRIVEN TESTING FRAMEWORK</b>

- Data driven testing framework has some advantages over the modular testing framework. 
- In this framework, the inputs and the expected outputs for a test case are all given. 
- Thus, the driver script can execute the test cases with multiple data sets which was difficult to do in the modular testing framework.
- A framework is a special case of software libraries in which reusable abstractions of code wrapped in a well-defined Application programming interface (API). However, they do contain some key distinguishing features that separate them from normal libraries.

Let us see an example in JUnit, a unit testing framework for the JAVA programming language.
