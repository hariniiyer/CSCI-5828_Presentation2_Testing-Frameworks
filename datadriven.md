<b>DATA DRIVEN TESTING FRAMEWORK</b>

- Data driven testing framework has its advantages over the modular testing framework. 
- In this framework, the inputs and the expected outputs for a test case are all given. 
- Thus the driver script can execute the test cases with multiple data sets which was difficult to do in the modular testing framework.
- A framework is a special case of software libraries in that they are reusable abstractions of code wrapped in a well-defined Application programming interface (API), yet they contain some key distinguishing features that separate them from normal libraries.

Let us see an example in JUnit (It is a unit testing framework for the JAVA programming language).
