- The process of breaking down the application into modules and testing them will reduce redundancy and increase maintainability of test cases.

- The application is broken down into modules based on the functionality.

- Even though this framework is time-consuming, the benefits outweigh the negatives.

- After a change has been made in one of the modules, all the scripts need not be updated with the new information instead, the regression tests can be automated. 

<b>Regression tests:</b>

- When a bug is rectified in an application, tests are done in order to verify if the change has affected the existing functionalities of the application. 

- For example, let us say there are two domains in an application. <br>

  - 1) Admin domain<br> 
  - 2) User’s domain<br>
  
- If there is a problem encountered by an authenticated admin in logging into the system, then the testers will send the application to the developer team to fix it. 

- After the development team fixes the bug, the testing team will again test the application to check if the functionalities of the other modules (user’s domain) and also the admin domain itself are affected.

- This method is so called the regression testing.
