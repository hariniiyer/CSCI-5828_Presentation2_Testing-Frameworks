<b>KEYWORD DRIVEN TESTING FRAMEWORK</b>

- Keyword driven testing is similar to the data driven testing except the fact that the test case is contained in the set of data values and is not hard coded in the test script itself.

- It is also known as table-driven testing. 

- It uses keywords to symbolize a functionality.

<b>EXAMPLE</b>

- Enter login name, Enter password --> Functionalities to be tested.

- Here, the keyword enter login name and enter password is defined as the set of actions that should be executed to update the database with a new user and his password. 

- This method uses a table structure to list the test cases.
