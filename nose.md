The nose is a unit testing framework in python. It is in fact can be called a discovery based extension for PyUnit. It makes testing more efficient and simpler. It can mimic the working of PyTest. It also supports test fixtures like unittest.

The best features of nose are :

+ No Boilerplate
+ Only some API
+ Compatible with other test methodologies
