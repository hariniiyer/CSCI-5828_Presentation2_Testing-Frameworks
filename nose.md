#####NOSE

The nose is a unit testing framework in python. It is in fact can be called a discovery based extension for PyUnit. It makes testing more efficient and simpler. It can mimic the working of PyTest. It also supports test fixtures like unittest.

The best features of nose are :

+ No Boilerplate
+ Only some API
+ Compatible with other test methodologies
+ Supports fixtures

It is called a discovery based test because nose tests start with <b> test_ </b>. 

With the help of test_, the test is identified as a nose test. The API used in nose is minimal. The extra API can be safely avoided without any harm to the functionality. It is compatible with doctest and unittest.
