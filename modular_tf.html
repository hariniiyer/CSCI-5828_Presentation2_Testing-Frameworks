<p>
Modular testing framework it is one of the most basic type of automation framework. In this framework, each 
module (functionality) is separated out and handled independently.

It requires the creation of small, independent scripts that represent modules, sections, and 
functions of the application-under-test. These scripts are then used in a hierarchical fashion 
to construct large tests.
