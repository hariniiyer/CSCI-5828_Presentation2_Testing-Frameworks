<b>When to use modular testing framework?</b>

- Modular test design may not be used by the testing team for all the projects. 

- Modularization is used when an application has a large regression baseline. 

- Whereas, those applications which has small regression baseline will not benefit much in adopting modularization. 

<b>ADVANTAGES:</b>

-	Easy maintenance since there are separate scripts for the modules.
-	Cost for developing the script is less since there will be code re-usage. 

<b>DISADVANTAGES:</b>

-	Since test data is embedded into the test scripts, whenever we need to test with a different set of data, manipulations need to be done in the test scripts.
