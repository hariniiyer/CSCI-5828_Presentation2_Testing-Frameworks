<b>What is a framework? </b>

<p>To understand the concept of framework better, let us take an example of making a clay doll. If a person wants to make a single clay doll, he will design it and carve out the features. But what if he wants to make 1000 dolls ? It is impossible to follow the same procedure for 1000 dolls. Hence, he will make a single mould pass the clay through it to make 1000 dolls. What he does here is nothing but make a framework. </p>

<b>What is a testing framework?</b>

<p>A testing framework is a set of assumptions, concepts and practices that provide support for automated software testing. Simply put, it is an execution environment for automated tests.</p>



<p>There are four popular types of framework methodologies which is being used by organizations today.</p>

- Modular
- Data-driven
- Keyword driven
- Hybrid


It is the up to the organization to take decisions on the type of testing framework they want to adopt for different projects.
