<b>How can we test the software?</b>
<p>
We can test the software application developed either manually using man power or we can automate the test cases and perform tests automatically with the use of the computer.
</p>

<b>MANUAL TESTING</b>

- Manual testing is a process that does not use the automated tools, scripts instead completely relies on man power.

- Manually testing the application is a tedious process. It is not only time consuming but also requires too much money to be spent on man labor.

<b>AUTOMATED TESTING</b>

- To facilitate and make things easier, automated testing frameworks were brought into existence. 
- <b>Automated testing is the process of testing which involves the use of software tools and frameworks to create test scripts that is used for executing the application and testing its results with the expected outputs.</b>
