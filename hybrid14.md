<b>CAPABILITIES:</b>

<b>Load Testing:</b>

- Load Testing determines if an application can support a specified load (for example, 500 concurrent users) with specified response times.
-  Load Testing is used to create benchmarks.

<b>Capacity Testing:</b>

- Capacity Testing determines the maximum load that an application can sustain before system failure.

<b>Functional Testing:</b>

- Functional Testing proves the correct behaviour of an application.

<b>Stress Testing:</b>

- Stress Testing determines if an application can meet specified goals for stability and reliability, under a specified load, for a specified time period.

<b>Dynamic scripting:</b>

- Test scripts are written using a dynamic scripting language, and specify the tests to run. 

- The default script language is Jython, a Java implementation of the popular Python language. 
 
- It allows arbitrary branching and looping and makes test results directly available to the test script, allowing different test paths to be taken depending on the outcome of each test.
